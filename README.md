# Data-Wrangling
Udacity Data Analysis Second Project on data wrangling
Chosen dataset: WeRateDogs extracted from Twitter

This twitter dataset (extracted from Twitter) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." 
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project. 
This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

**For this investigation, we specifically gathered 3 datasets for WeRateDogs tweets on dog ratings. We then wrangled and got some insights on them.**
